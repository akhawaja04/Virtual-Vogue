Virtual Vogue is an AI-powered virtual try-on platform that creates realistic images of users wearing selected garments. By combining a clothing image and a user photo, the system accurately aligns and renders the outfit on the person.

Built on a latent diffusion model, Virtual Vogue integrates pose and body shape analysis using PoseNet and DensePose, while CLIP and IP-Adapter preserve garment style and detail. Advanced attention mechanisms ensure high-quality, photorealistic results even under complex poses and lighting.

Ideal for modern fashion retail, Virtual Vogue offers an immersive and realistic try-on experience.
